# Lua VM Implementation Status Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the Lua VM for Ferrous Redis, updated as of July 2025. It is based on the architectural specifications in the `LUA_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LUA_TRANSACTION_PATTERNS.md`, and other design documents.

**Current Overall Status**: The core VM functions for basic Lua scripts. Recent fixes have addressed critical issues with table return values and LOADNIL opcode handling. The VM can now execute scripts with arithmetic operations, basic control flow, table creation/manipulation, and return complex data structures like tables. Simple closures work, but complex upvalue handling has issues. Many standard library functions are still placeholder implementations, and Redis integration is minimal. Development should continue with improving upvalue handling and completing the standard library before Redis integration.

## Recent Fixes

1. **Table Return Values (July 2025)**
   - Fixed a critical issue where tables weren't properly returned from Lua scripts
   - The bug was in the compiler's `emit_return` method, which generated RETURN instructions with B=1 (meaning "return 0 values") when it should have used B=2 (meaning "return 1 value")
   - Now tables can be properly created, manipulated, and returned from scripts

2. **LOADNIL Parameter Handling (July 2025)**
   - Fixed an incorrect implementation of the LOADNIL opcode
   - The implementation was setting B+1 registers to nil instead of B registers as per Lua 5.1 spec
   - Now variable initialization and assignments that set multiple variables to nil work correctly

3. **Register Allocation (July 2025)**
   - Fixed a critical issue where registers were prematurely freed by the compiler
   - Implemented proper register lifetime tracking across nested expressions
   - Resolved issues with function calls containing concatenation expressions
   - Fixed VM handling of CONCAT with correct immediate vs. deferred operation handling

## Critical Implementation Priorities

1. **Improve Upvalue and Closure Handling**
   - Fix complex upvalue capturing issues
   - Complete the upvalue closing mechanism
   - Ensure proper upvalue sharing between closures

2. **Complete Standard Library**
   - Add remaining math library functions
   - Implement full string library with pattern matching
   - Complete table manipulation functions
   - Replace placeholder implementations with proper code

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Implement xpcall
   - Add proper traceback generation
   - Complete error propagation logic
   - Include source locations in error messages

4. **Add Memory Management**
   - Implement non-recursive garbage collection
   - Add memory pressure monitoring
   - Implement resource limits

5. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Add more complex test scripts
   - Test edge cases in standard library functions
   - Ensure full compliance with Lua 5.1

## Conclusion

The Lua VM implementation has a solid architectural foundation with recent fixes addressing critical issues in opcode handling. The VM can now execute simple to moderately complex scripts, including arithmetic operations, control flow, table manipulation, and returning tables from functions. Areas that need further work include upvalue handling in complex closures, completing the standard library, error handling with tracebacks, and implementing garbage collection. The Redis integration layer remains a lower priority until the core VM functionality is complete and stable.
