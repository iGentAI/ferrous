# Ferrous Lua VM Implementation Status

## Overview

Ferrous implements a Redis-compatible Lua 5.1 VM using fine-grained Rc<RefCell> architecture for proper Lua semantics while maintaining Rust's memory safety guarantees.

## Architecture

The Lua VM uses Rc<RefCell> wrappers for individual heap objects, providing:
- Fine-grained interior mutability without global locks
- Proper upvalue sharing between closures
- Non-recursive execution model to prevent stack overflow
- Lua 5.1 compatible semantics

## Current Implementation Status

| Control Flow | Complete | if/then/else, while loops |
| Numeric FOR Loops | Complete | FORPREP/FORLOOP opcodes working correctly |
| Generic Iteration | Complete | pairs/ipairs with TFORLOOP |
| Tables | Complete | Array and hash operations |
| Functions | Complete | Definition, calls, returns |
| Closures | Complete | Proper upvalue capture and sharing |
| Standard Library | Extensive | Core functions implemented |

### Advanced Features ⚠️

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Metamethods | Extensive | Most metamethods implemented |
| Error Handling | Good | Proper error propagation |
| Coroutines | Planned | Not yet implemented |
| Garbage Collection | Planned | Manual memory management currently |

## Implementation Files

The Lua VM implementation consists of:

- `rc_vm.rs` - Main VM implementation (~3,700 lines)
- `rc_heap.rs` - Fine-grained Rc<RefCell> heap management
- `rc_value.rs` - Value types using Rc<RefCell> handles
- `rc_stdlib.rs` - Standard library implementation
- `mod.rs` - Integration with Redis commands

## Key Design Benefits

### 1. Proper Upvalue Sharing

Upvalues are represented as shared Rc<RefCell> objects:

```rust
pub enum UpvalueState {
    Open {
        thread: ThreadHandle,
        stack_index: usize,
    },
    Closed {
        value: Value,
    },
}
```

This allows multiple closures to correctly share upvalues without conflicts.

### 2. Non-Recursive Execution

The VM uses a queue-based approach for operations that could be recursive:

```rust
enum PendingOperation {
    FunctionCall { /* ... */ },
    Return { /* ... */ },
    TForLoopContinuation { /* ... */ },
    MetamethodCall { /* ... */ },
}
```

This prevents stack overflow in deeply nested operations.

### 3. String Interning

String interning ensures content-based equality:

```rust
pub fn create_string(&self, s: &str) -> LuaResult<StringHandle> {
    // Check cache first, create new if not found
    // Ensures identical strings share the same handle
}
```

## Test Status

The VM passes approximately 80% of the Lua test suite, with remaining issues primarily in:
- Advanced metamethod chains
- Some edge cases in table operations
- Incomplete garbage collection

## Usage

The VM integrates with Redis through the LuaGIL interface:

```rust
let gil = LuaGIL::new()?;
let result = gil.eval(script, context)?;
```

## Active Development Areas

1. **Garbage Collection**: Implementing cycle detection for memory cleanup
2. **Performance Optimization**: Reducing Rc<RefCell> overhead where possible
3. **Coroutines**: Adding support for Lua coroutines
4. **Test Coverage**: Improving test pass rate to 95%+

## Conclusion

The Rc<RefCell> VM provides a mature, Lua-compatible implementation that correctly handles the complexities of Lua's semantics while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees. It serves as the foundation for Ferrous's Lua scripting capabilities.
