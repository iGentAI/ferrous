# Lua VM Implementation Status Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the Lua VM for Ferrous Redis. It is based on the architectural specifications in the `LUA_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LUA_TRANSACTION_PATTERNS.md`, and other design documents.

**Current Overall Status**: Core implementation is nearly complete with recently fixed compiler and bytecode generation components. The VM is now capable of executing basic Lua code including arithmetic operations, function definitions, and function calls. All core architectural patterns are being followed correctly. The implementation is ready for standard library integration and Redis API development.

## Core Components Status

| **Value System** | ✅ Complete | All Lua value types implemented with proper attributes, including Function Prototypes | Done |
| **Handle System** | ✅ Complete | Handle wrapper types implemented with proper traits | Done |
| **Heap** | ✅ Complete | Object storage with arenas and string interning | Done |
| **Transaction** | ✅ Complete | Fully implemented with proper validation and caching | Done |
| **Handle Validation** | ✅ Complete | Type-safe validation framework with validation caching implemented | Done |
| **C Function Execution** | ✅ Complete | Isolated execution context with transaction-safe boundaries | Done |
| **VM Structure** | ✅ Complete | Core state machine with all opcodes implemented | Done |
| **Closure System** | ✅ Complete | Function prototype support, upvalue lifecycle management, and lexical scoping implemented | Done |
| **Compiler** | ⚠️ Partial | Lexer and parser implemented, bytecode generation with proper opcode encoding now working | Medium |
| **Metamethod System** | ✅ Complete | Full metamethod support for tables, arithmetic, comparisons, and concatenation | Done |
| **Redis API Integration** | ❌ Missing | Almost completely absent; returns "not implemented" errors | High |
| **Error Handling** | ⚠️ Partial | Error types defined but not fully implemented | Medium |

## Recently Fixed Components (July 2025)

### 1. Bytecode Encoding

Fixed the critical issue with bytecode instruction encoding:
- **Root cause**: Opcode enum values were being directly cast to u32 instead of mapping to the correct opcode numbers
- **Impact**: Generated incorrect opcodes (ADD being encoded as SUB, RETURN being encoded as FORPREP)
- **Fix**: Modified encoding functions to use proper `opcode_to_u8` mapping function

### 2. Stack Management

Improved stack initialization and register access:
- **Root cause**: Stack was not properly initialized before function execution
- **Impact**: "Stack index out of bounds" errors during execution
- **Fix**: Properly reserve stack space based on function's max_stack_size before execution
- **Fix**: Enhanced register access safety with automatic stack growth

### 3. Function Prototype Handling

Fixed function prototype handling for nested functions:
- **Root cause**: Prototype references weren't properly transferred from compiler to module loader
- **Impact**: "Invalid function prototype index" errors when executing functions
- **Fix**: Implemented two-pass loading approach that handles forward references
- **Fix**: Proper propagation of function prototypes from code generator to module

### 4. Parser Functionality

Fixed function body parsing:
- **Root cause**: Parse logic treated Return as a block terminator rather than a statement
- **Impact**: Parser error: "Expected 'end' after function body: expected End, got Return"
- **Fix**: Modified parser to properly handle return statements within function bodies

## Critical Implementation Gaps

While the core VM and compiler are now working, three major components remain to be implemented:

1. **Standard Library**: The standard Lua library (string, table, math functions) is not implemented.

2. **Redis API**: The redis.call() and redis.pcall() functions are not yet implemented, and the KEYS and ARGV tables are not properly set up.

3. **Error Handling**: The pcall and xpcall functions are not implemented, and error propagation is incomplete.

These components can be built on top of the solid VM foundation and compiler that's now in place, as they don't require changes to the core architecture.

## Architecture Compliance

The implementation strictly follows these architectural principles:

1. **Non-Recursive State Machine**: ✅ Compliant
   - Execution loop implemented with no recursion
   - Operations queued for later execution
   - Proper handling of function calls, metamethods, and control flow

2. **Transaction-Based Heap Access**: ✅ Compliant
   - All heap operations go through transactions
   - No direct heap access outside transactions
   - Proper commit/rollback semantics

3. **Handle-Based Memory Management**: ✅ Compliant
   - All dynamic objects use arena-based handles
   - Copy/Clone properly implemented for handles
   - All handle creation is type-safe with no unsafe code

4. **Two-Phase Borrowing Pattern**: ✅ Compliant
   - Implemented for complex operations like metatable access
   - Used in C function execution pattern
   - Tests verify functionality

5. **Proper Handle Validation**: ✅ Compliant
   - Type-safe validation via `ValidatableHandle` trait
   - Validation at transaction entry points
   - Validation before reallocation
   - Validation caching for performance

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the current status, these are the implementation priorities:

1. **Implement Standard Library** (High Priority)
   - Basic global functions (print, type, etc.)
   - String library functions
   - Table library functions
   - Math library functions

2. **Implement Redis API** (High Priority)
   - Add redis.call() and redis.pcall() functions
   - Implement KEYS and ARGV table setup
   - Add proper error handling for Redis commands

3. **Expand Testing Suite** (Medium Priority)
   - Add comprehensive language feature tests
   - Test complex table operations
   - Test nested closures and upvalues
   - Test metatables thoroughly

4. **Implement Error Handling** (Medium Priority)
   - Add pcall and xpcall functionality
   - Implement proper traceback generation
   - Add error propagation through the call stack

## Conclusion

The Lua VM implementation has made significant progress with the recent fixes to the parser, bytecode generation, stack management, and function prototype handling. The core execution engine is now working correctly and can handle basic Lua scripts with arithmetic operations, function definitions, and function calls. 

The foundation is solid and aligned with all architectural principles, making it an excellent base for implementing the remaining components like the standard library and Redis API integration. With these fixes in place, we've removed the major blocking issues that were preventing the VM from executing even simple Lua code.
