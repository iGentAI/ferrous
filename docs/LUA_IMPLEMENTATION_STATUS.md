# Lua VM Implementation Status Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the Lua VM for Ferrous Redis, updated as of July 2025. It is based on the architectural specifications in the `LUA_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LUA_TRANSACTION_PATTERNS.md`, and other design documents.

**Current Overall Status**: The core VM implementation is functional with recently fixed register allocation. The VM is capable of executing Lua scripts with arithmetic operations, control flow, function definitions/calls, and concatenation with proper string interning. All core architectural patterns are correctly implemented. Many standard library functions are still placeholder implementations, and Redis integration is minimal. Development should continue with completing the standard library before Redis integration.

## Critical Implementation Priorities

1. **Complete Standard Library**
   - Add remaining math library functions
   - Implement full string library with pattern matching
   - Complete table manipulation functions
   - Replace placeholder implementations with proper code

2. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Implement xpcall
   - Add proper traceback generation
   - Complete error propagation logic
   - Include source locations in error messages

3. **Add Memory Management**

   - Implement script caching (EVALSHA)

## Recent Fixes

1. **Register Allocation (July 2025)**
   - Fixed a critical issue where registers were prematurely freed by the compiler
   - Implemented proper register lifetime tracking across nested expressions
   - Resolved issues with function calls containing concatenation expressions
   - Fixed VM handling of CONCAT with correct immediate vs. deferred operation handling

2. **String Interning (June 2025)**
   - Verified and completed the string interning system
   - Ensured consistent string identity semantics
   - Fixed issues with function name lookup through proper interning

## Known TODOs and Placeholders

See `LUA_VM_PLACEHOLDER_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md` for a full catalog of TODOs and placeholders in the codebase.

## Conclusion

The Lua VM implementation has a solid architectural foundation with the core components functioning correctly. The critical register allocation issues have been resolved, allowing nested expressions and function calls to work properly. Focus should now shift to completing the standard library implementation and addressing the placeholder implementations throughout the codebase.
