# Lua Implementation Status

This document outlines the current implementation status of the Lua VM in the Ferrous project.

## Overall Status

The Lua VM implementation is **functional for core operations** but not yet complete. We have successfully implemented all major Lua 5.1 opcodes with register window support and have basic upvalue/closure capabilities working. The VM can execute simple scripts with variables, functions, closures, arithmetic operations, and basic control flow.

## What's Working

### Core VM Infrastructure
- [x] Register window system
- [x] Transaction-based memory management
- [x] Non-recursive execution model
- [x] Safe handle management
- [x] Basic error handling

### Language Features
- [x] Local variables and basic expressions
- [x] Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^, unary -)
- [x] Function definitions and calls
- [x] Closures with upvalues
- [x] Global variables
- [x] Basic string operations
- [x] Tables (creation, get, set)
- [x] Comparison operations
- [x] Basic control flow (if/then, loops)

### Standard Library
- [x] Basic library functions (print, type)
- [ ] Complete standard library
- [ ] C function integration with API

## Implementation Challenges

Our implementation has faced several significant challenges:

1. **Borrow Checker Conflicts**: The Rust borrow checker poses challenges for a VM implementation, particularly around:
   - Register window access during transactions
   - Upvalue handling in closures
   - Function calls with nested operations

2. **Performance Implications**: The current implementation prioritizes safety over performance:
   - Transaction overhead adds significant cost
   - Handle validation on every access
   - Frequent cloning to satisfy ownership rules

3. **Architecture Limitations**: The register window and transaction architecture:
   - Increases code complexity
   - Makes debugging more difficult
   - Creates many indirection layers

## Recent Improvements

Recent work has focused on making upvalues and closures work properly with the register window system. Key fixes include:

1. **Closure Creation**: Fixed borrow checker issues in the Closure opcode by using proper phase separation.
2. **Register Window Synchronization**: Implemented proper synchronization between register windows and the thread stack.
3. **Upvalue Capture**: Fixed upvalue creation to correctly capture variables from parent scopes.
4. **Transaction Lifecycle**: Improved transaction handling to avoid "invalid transaction state" errors.

## Testing Status

The following test scripts are working:
- test_minimal.lua - Basic VM functionality
- test_simple.lua - Simple arithmetic and variable operations
- test_move.lua - Register operations
- test_minimal_upvalue.lua - Basic upvalue capture
- test_upvalue_counter.lua - Upvalue state maintenance
- test_upvalue_basic.lua - Function factory with upvalues
- test_print_minimal.lua - Print function basics

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Priorities**:
   - Improve return value handling
   - Fix remaining issues with C function arguments
   - Complete standard library implementation
   - Implement error propagation with stack traces

2. **Testing Priorities**:
   - Add comprehensive upvalue tests
   - Create tests for all standard library functions
   - Add stress tests for register windows

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update implementation patterns documentation
   - Create debugging guide for the VM

## Performance Considerations

The current implementation faces significant performance challenges due to its architecture. A detailed design for a more performant hybrid approach has been created in [LUA_VM_PERFORMANT_HYBRID_DESIGN.md](./LUA_VM_PERFORMANT_HYBRID_DESIGN.md). This would be a potential future direction after completing the current implementation.
