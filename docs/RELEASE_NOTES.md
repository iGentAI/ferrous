# Ferrous Release Notes

## Version 0.1.1 (July 31, 2025) - Global Lua Script Cache & Performance Improvements

### Major Features

#### Global Lua Script Cache Implementation
- **Fixed SCRIPT LOAD/EVALSHA cross-connection compatibility** - scripts loaded on one connection now available via EVALSHA on any connection
- **Implemented zero-overhead lazy locking** - script cache locks only acquired for Lua operations (EVAL, EVALSHA, SCRIPT commands)
- **Removed per-connection script caches** - replaced with thread-safe global cache using Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>
- **Trait-based ScriptCaching abstraction** - follows same zero-overhead pattern as monitoring system
- **Redis-standard behavior** - full compatibility with Redis Lua script caching semantics

#### Performance Achievements vs Valkey 8.0.4
- **Exceeds Valkey performance** in 8 out of 9 core operations (106-126% throughput)
- **110% GET performance** - 81,301 ops/sec vs 74,074 ops/sec
- **126% LPOP performance** - 78,740 ops/sec vs 62,500 ops/sec  
- **112% PING performance** - 81,967 ops/sec vs 72,993 ops/sec
- **Equal pipelined performance** - both achieve 769,231 ops/sec peak throughput
- **Lower latencies** - p50 latencies 5-10% better than Valkey (0.287ms vs 0.319ms)

#### Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **Aligned test configurations** - removed authentication expectations from default test scripts
- **Fixed test/server configuration mismatch** - all basic tests now run without authentication errors
- **Maintained auth-enabled test scenarios** - replication tests still use authentication as intended
- **Improved test reliability** - comprehensive protocol tests now pass all scenarios including multi-client

### Performance Improvements
- **Zero-overhead global script cache** - no performance impact on non-Lua operations
- **Optimized connection handling** - removed per-connection script cache overhead
- **Enhanced logging performance** - proper log redirection can double SET operation throughput
- **Improved concurrent client performance** - 113% of Valkey performance with 50 concurrent clients

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed EVALSHA cross-connection failures** - scripts are now globally accessible
- **Resolved script cache visibility issues** - eliminated per-connection cache isolation
- **Fixed test authentication mismatches** - tests now align with default server configuration
- **Enhanced script caching reliability** - proper error handling and lock management

### Technical Architecture
- **Trait-based lazy locking** - ScriptCaching trait provides zero-overhead abstraction
- **Global state management** - Arc<dyn ScriptCaching> shared across all connections
- **Consistent with monitoring system** - follows established zero-overhead patterns
- **Thread-safe implementation** - RwLock provides concurrent read access with exclusive writes

### Validation Results
- **All unit tests pass** - 57 Rust unit/integration tests completed successfully
- **All Lua tests pass** - end-to-end and integration Lua scripting tests pass
- **Protocol compliance verified** - comprehensive RESP protocol tests pass
- **Performance benchmarked** - thorough comparison against Valkey 8.0.4 completed

## Next Steps
- **Cluster support** implementation for horizontal scaling
- **HyperLogLog** data structure implementation  
- **Advanced monitoring** enhancements for production deployment
- **Memory optimization** for large-scale deployments

Global Lua script cache implementation, performance optimization, and test infrastructure improvements by the Ferrous team.
