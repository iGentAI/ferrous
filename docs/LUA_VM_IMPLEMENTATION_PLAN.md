# Lua VM Implementation Plan for Ferrous

## Current State Assessment

After our implementation efforts and recent fixes, we've addressed several critical architectural issues and learned important lessons that will guide the remaining implementation work:

1. **Transaction Consistency**: We've ensured consistent transaction usage, fixing borrow checker conflicts.
2. **Non-Recursive Execution**: The VM now follows a true non-recursive execution model with proper pending operations.
3. **Stack Management**: We've fixed stack initialization and register access with proper bounds checking.
4. **Bytecode Generation**: The compiler now generates correct opcodes with proper encoding.
5. **Function Prototype Handling**: We've implemented a two-pass approach for function prototypes that handles forward references.

## Key Lessons Learned

From our debugging and fixing effort, we've learned several important lessons:

1. **Opcode Encoding Matters**: Direct enum casting doesn't work for opcodes; explicit mapping is required.
2. **Stack Pre-allocation**: All registers that might be accessed must be pre-allocated before function execution.
3. **Two-Phase Function Loading**: Nested functions require a two-pass approach to handle circular references.
4. **Defensive Register Access**: Register access should be robust against out-of-bounds conditions.
5. **Parser Design**: Careful distinction between block terminators and statements is essential.

   - Add error handling functions (assert, error)

2. **String Library**
   - Implement string.sub, string.find, string.gsub, etc.
   - Add pattern matching functionality
   - Test string operations thoroughly

### Phase 3: Redis Integration (1-2 weeks)

1. **Command Interface**
   - Implement redis.call and redis.pcall
   - Set up KEYS and ARGV tables
   - Add sandboxing for Redis commands

2. **EVAL/EVALSHA Commands**
   - Implement command handlers
   - Add script caching with SHA1
   - Create script loading and execution

3. **Security and Resource Limits**
   - Add instruction and memory limits
   - Implement timeout mechanism
   - Create proper sandboxing

## Implementation Requirements

Our implementation has validated the following requirements:

### Transaction Consistency

**ALL** operations that access the heap must go through transactions:

```rust
// Create transaction
let mut tx = HeapTransaction::new(&mut self.heap);

// Use transaction for ALL access
let index_str = tx.create_string("__index")?;
let metatable = tx.get_metatable(table)?;

// Only commit at the very end
tx.commit()?;
```

### Non-Recursive Function Calls

**NO** recursive function calls are allowed:

```rust
// NEVER do this
let result = self.execute_function(closure, &args)?;

// ALWAYS do this
tx.queue_operation(PendingOperation::FunctionCall {
    closure,
    args: args.clone(),
    context: CallContext::Register { base, offset },
});
// ... and let the main execution loop handle it
```

### Safe Stack Management

**ALWAYS** ensure sufficient stack space before execution:

```rust
// Calculate needed stack size
let needed_stack_size = max_stack_size as usize;

// Reserve stack space
if current_stack_size < needed_stack_size {
    for _ in current_stack_size..needed_stack_size {
        tx.push_stack(thread, Value::Nil)?;
    }
}
```

### Proper Bytecode Encoding

**NEVER** directly cast OpCode enums to integers:

```rust
// WRONG - Direct enum casting
let op = opcode as u32 & 0x3F;

// RIGHT - Use mapping function
let op = opcode_to_u8(opcode) as u32 & 0x3F;
```

## Testing Strategy

We've developed a robust testing strategy that includes:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Component isolation tests
   - Transaction consistency tests
   - Handle validation tests
   - Memory management tests

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Opcode sequence execution tests
   - Function call and return tests
   - Basic language feature tests
   - Simple script execution tests

3. **Remaining Test Development Needs**
   - Comprehensive language feature tests
   - Standard library function tests
   - Redis command integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks against Redis

## Success Criteria

Our implementation is progressing well toward meeting these criteria:

1. ✅ Core architecture follows design principles and passes unit tests
2. ⚠️ Basic scripts execute correctly, but need full language test suite
3. ❌ No Redis integration tests yet
4. ❌ Performance benchmarking not started
5. ✅ Memory safety maintained with clean Rust safety
6. ⚠️ No borrow checker errors in core implementation, need more complex testing

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress by fixing critical issues in the Lua VM implementation. The fixes align the implementation with the architectural principles and demonstrate that the core design is sound. With these fixes in place, we can now proceed with completing the language feature set, implementing the standard library, and integrating with Redis.

The path forward is clear: focus on completing remaining language features, implementing the standard library, and then building the Redis integration layer. The foundation is solid, and remaining work can proceed on this stable base.
