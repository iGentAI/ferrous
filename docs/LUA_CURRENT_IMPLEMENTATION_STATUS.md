# Lua VM Current Implementation Status

## Overview

This document describes the current implementation status of the RefCellVM-based Lua interpreter in Ferrous as of July 2025. The implementation has transitioned from a transaction-based architecture to a RefCellVM architecture that uses interior mutability through Rust's `RefCell` type. This document is based on comprehensive test results and provides a detailed status report for different Lua language features.

## Implementation Status Summary

Based on our test suite results, out of 21 total tests, the current implementation passes 8 tests (38%) and fails 13 tests (62%). The status by feature category is as follows:

| Feature Category | Tests Passing | Tests Total | Pass Rate |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Basic Language Features | 6 | 6 | 100% |
| Table Operations | 1 | 3 | 33% |
| Functions and Closures | 0 | 5 | 0% |
| Control Flow | 1 | 3 | 33% |
| Standard Library | 0 | 4 | 0% |

## Feature Status Breakdown

### Working Features

#### Basic Language Features (100% Passing)

- **Variable Assignment and Declarations**:
  - Local and global variable declarations
  - Basic variable assignments
  - Multiple variable assignments

- **Primitive Types**:
  - `nil` values
  - Booleans (`true`, `false`)
  - Numbers (integers and floating point)
  - Strings (with escapes and concatenation)

- **Basic Operations**:
  - Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^)
  - String concatenation (.. operator)
  - Type identification (`type` function)
  - String conversion (`tostring` function)
  - Output (`print` function)

#### Table Operations (Partial)

- **Basic Table Creation**: Creating simple tables using {} syntax
- **Basic Table Access**: Reading from tables with simple keys

#### Control Flow (Partial)

- **Numeric FOR Loops**: The `for i=start,limit,step do` syntax works correctly
  - Properly handles nil step values by defaulting to 1.0
  - Properly handles optional step parameter
  - Correctly manages loop variable and termination condition

### Partially Working Features

#### Table Operations

- **Table Field Assignment**: Basic field assignment works, but complex scenarios fail
- **Table Creation**: Simple tables work, but nested tables have issues

#### Control Flow

- **Conditional Statements**: Basic if/then/else appears to work in simple cases
- **While Loops**: Simple while loops may work, but are not fully tested

### Non-Working Features

#### Functions and Closures (0% Passing)

- **Function Definitions**: Local and global function definitions
- **Function Expressions**: Anonymous functions
- **Closures**: Functions that capture local variables
- **Upvalues**: Variable capture across nested functions
- **Varargs**: Variable argument functions (`...`)
- **Tail Calls**: Tail call optimization

#### Generic Iteration (0% Passing)

- **Generic FOR Loops**: The `for k,v in pairs(t) do` syntax
- **Iterator Functions**: `pairs()`, `ipairs()`, and `next()`
- **Custom Iterators**: User-defined iterator functions

#### Standard Library (0% Passing)

- **Table Library**: `table.insert()`, `table.remove()`, etc.
- **String Library**: `string.sub()`, `string.match()`, etc.
- **Math Library**: `math.abs()`, `math.sin()`, etc.
- **Error Handling**: `pcall()`, `error()`, etc.
- **Metatables**: `getmetatable()`, `setmetatable()`
- **Redis API**: `redis.call()`, `redis.pcall()`

## Technical Implementation Status

### Core VM Components

- **RefCellHeap**: 90% complete
  - Arena-based memory management is working
  - Interior mutability via RefCell is working
  - String interning is functional
  - Table operations work for basic cases
  - All handle types are implemented

- **RefCellVM**: 70% complete
  - Core execution loop is working
  - Basic opcode handlers are implemented
  - Non-recursive call mechanism is functional
  - Critical register management (FOR loops) is fixed

- **Opcode Implementation**: 60% complete
  - Basic opcodes (MOVE, LOADK, LOADNIL, arithmetic) work correctly
  - Table opcodes (NEWTABLE, GETTABLE, SETTABLE) work for basic cases
  - Control flow opcodes (JMP, TEST, FORPREP, FORLOOP) are functional
  - Some advanced opcodes (TFORLOOP, TAILCALL, CLOSURE) need work

- **Standard Library**: 30% complete
  - Basic functions (print, type, tostring) are implemented
  - More complex functions need work
  - Library table organization is in place

- **Memory Management**: 70% complete
  - Arena-based allocation is working
  - Handle validation is functional
  - No garbage collection implemented yet

## Critical Issues

1. **Function Implementation**: The current implementation fails all function-related tests, which is a critical limitation. Function definitions, closures, and upvalue handling need significant work.

2. **Generic Iteration**: The implementation of `pairs()` and `ipairs()` is not functional, which limits the usability of tables for iteration.

3. **Metamethods**: Table metamethods like `__index` and `__newindex` are not fully implemented, limiting advanced table usage.

## Next Steps

Based on the current status, here are the recommended next steps for implementation:

1. **Function Implementation**: 
   - Complete function definition functionality
   - Implement closure and upvalue handling
   - Add varargs support
   - Add tail call optimization

2. **Generic Iteration**:
   - Fix TFORLOOP opcode implementation
   - Implement correct pairs() and ipairs() functions
   - Add proper next() function support

3. **Standard Library Completion**:
   - Complete the base library functions
   - Implement table, string, and math libraries
   - Add error handling functions

4. **Metamethod Support**:
   - Implement full metamethod handling for tables
   - Add support for arithmetic and comparison metamethods

## Conclusion

The migration from the transaction-based VM to the RefCellVM implementation has successfully addressed the critical register corruption issues in FOR loops. The basic language features are working well, but significant work remains to implement function-related features and more advanced language constructs. The core architecture is solid, providing a foundation for completing the remaining features.
