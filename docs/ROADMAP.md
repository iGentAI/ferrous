## Current Status

Phases 1-3 are fully implemented and functional. The server currently supports:
- All basic Redis commands and data structures
- RDB and AOF persistence
- Pub/Sub messaging
- Transactions with WATCH/MULTI/EXEC

Performance is currently around 70% of Redis performance for basic operations like SET/GET. The biggest remaining performance gaps are in pipelining and concurrent client handling, which will be addressed in Phase 4.
