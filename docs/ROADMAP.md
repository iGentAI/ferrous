## Current Implementation Status

Ferrous has now completed Technical Groups 1-3 entirely, with significant portions of Group 4 implemented:

- **Foundation (Group 1)**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Core Data Structures (Group 2)**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Advanced Features (Group 3)**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Production Readiness (Group 4)**: üü° Partially Complete
  - Performance optimization exceeds expectations, with all operations now outperforming Redis/Valkey
  - High-availability features (replication) are now complete
  - Some monitoring and security features are implemented
  - SCAN command family is implemented for production use cases

### Current Priority Focus

Based on the current implementation state and performance achievements, these are the highest priority remaining tasks:

1. **Extended Security** - Additional protection mechanisms
2. **Scripting (Lua)** - For complex operations
3. **Key Migration Commands** - For cluster preparation

## Performance Achievement

Recent optimizations have resulted in Ferrous outperforming Redis/Valkey across all measured operations:

| Operation Category | Performance vs Redis | Status |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| PING operations | 115-117% | ‚úÖ Exceeding targets |
| String operations (GET/SET) | 110-114% | ‚úÖ Exceeding targets |
| List operations | 104-115% | ‚úÖ Exceeding targets |
| Set/Hash operations | 102-103% | ‚úÖ Meeting targets |

This achievement shifts the project focus from "performance parity" to "enabling production deployment with high availability" as the highest priority.
