## Current Status

Ferrous has now completed Phases 1-3 entirely, with significant portions of Phase 4 implemented:

- All core data structures and commands are fully functional
- Persistence (RDB and AOF) is working correctly
- Pub/Sub and Transactions are implemented and tested
- Pipeline support is complete and high-performance
- Concurrent client handling is robust up to 50+ clients
- Configuration commands are implemented
- Authentication is working correctly

Performance has been optimized for both single operations and pipelined commands. Benchmark results show outstanding performance, with pipelined operations reaching 230,000+ ops/sec.

The next focus will be completing the remaining Phase 4 features, particularly replication and additional monitoring tools.
