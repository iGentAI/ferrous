# Introducing Master-Slave Replication in Ferrous 0.1.0

We're excited to announce the release of Ferrous 0.1.0, which introduces full master-slave replication support! This major feature brings Ferrous one step closer to being a production-ready Redis-compatible server for high-availability deployments.

## What is Ferrous?

Ferrous is a Redis-compatible in-memory database server written in pure Rust with zero external dependencies. It provides all the core functionality of Redis with the performance and safety guarantees of Rust. Already surpassing Redis/Valkey performance in benchmarks, Ferrous is becoming a compelling alternative for applications requiring a high-performance in-memory database.

## Replication in Ferrous

Replication allows you to create multiple copies of your Ferrous database across different servers, providing several key benefits:

1. **High Availability**: If your master server fails, you can promote a replica to take its place.
2. **Read Scaling**: Distribute read queries across multiple replicas to handle higher loads.
3. **Data Security**: Create backups without impacting your master server's performance.
4. **Geographical Distribution**: Deploy replicas in different regions for lower-latency reads.

## Setting Up Replication

Ferrous provides multiple ways to configure replication:

### Using Configuration Files

```bash
# Start the master
./ferrous master.conf

# Start the replica
./ferrous replica.conf
```

### Using Dynamic Configuration

```bash
# Start two Ferrous instances
./ferrous --port 6379 &
./ferrous --port 6380 &

# Configure replication
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6380 REPLICAOF 127.0.0.1 6379
```

## Key Features

### 1. Redis-Compatible Commands

Ferrous implements the same replication commands as Redis:

- `REPLICAOF <host> <port>`: Configure as a replica of the specified master
- `REPLICAOF NO ONE`: Promote a replica to master
- `INFO replication`: View replication status and statistics

### 2. Secure Authentication

Replicas authenticate with masters using the same password mechanism as regular clients, ensuring your replication links are secure.

### 3. Full RDB Synchronization

When a replica connects to a master, it performs a full synchronization:

1. Master creates an RDB snapshot of its data
2. RDB file is transferred to the replica
3. Replica loads the RDB data into memory
4. Master begins forwarding commands to the replica

### 4. Role Transitions

Replicas can be promoted to masters and vice versa, allowing for flexible maintenance and failover scenarios.

## Performance Impact

Our benchmarks show that enabling replication has minimal impact on Ferrous's overall performance. Thanks to Rust's efficient threading model and zero-copy optimizations, Ferrous maintains its performance edge over Redis/Valkey even with replication enabled.

| Operation | Ferrous (Release) | Valkey | Ratio |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|-------|
| SET | 84,889 ops/sec | 74,515 ops/sec | **114%** |
| GET | 69,881 ops/sec | 63,451 ops/sec | **110%** |
| LPUSH | 81,366 ops/sec | 74,850 ops/sec | **109%** |
| RPUSH | 75,987 ops/sec | 73,046 ops/sec | **104%** |

## What's Next?

With replication now complete, our roadmap for Ferrous includes:

1. **Production Monitoring**: Implementing MONITOR and SLOWLOG for better debugging and performance analysis
2. **Enhanced Security**: Additional security features to protect your data
3. **Lua Scripting**: Support for custom logic execution
4. **Partial Replication**: More efficient replication after disconnections

## Getting Started

To get started with Ferrous replication:

1. Download the latest release from our repository
2. Create configuration files for master and replica instances
3. Start your instances and verify replication status

For detailed setup instructions, see our comprehensive [Replication Guide](REPLICATION_GUIDE.md).

## Conclusion

The addition of master-slave replication makes Ferrous a viable option for production deployments requiring high availability. Combined with Ferrous's inherent performance advantages and Rust's safety guarantees, replication takes us one step closer to a truly production-ready Redis-compatible server.

We encourage you to try out replication in Ferrous 0.1.0 and provide feedback on your experience. Your input helps us continue improving and refining the project.

Happy replicating!
