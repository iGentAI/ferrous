# Ferrous Test Results Report

**Date**: June 25, 2025
**Version**: 0.1.0 (Phase 4 Implementation)

## Executive Summary

The Ferrous Redis-compatible server has been successfully implemented through Phase 4, with significant features now complete. All core functionality tests passed, demonstrating 100% protocol compatibility for implemented commands. The server remained stable under stress testing, including high-throughput pipeline operations and concurrent client scenarios. Performance tests show excellent results compared to Redis, with some operations exceeding Redis performance in pipelined mode. Recently implemented features including master-slave replication, SLOWLOG, MONITOR, CLIENT commands, and memory tracking are fully functional and pass all tests. The Lua scripting implementation has been significantly improved, with a working cjson.encode function, though some limitations remain with complex table field operations.

## Memory Tracking Performance Analysis

The memory tracking implementation has minimal performance impact when tested with proper production configuration (output redirection). Compared to the original targets:

| Operation | Original Target | Current Result | Change |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| SET       | 73,500 ops/sec | 72,674 ops/sec | -1.1%  |
| GET       | 72,500 ops/sec | 81,566 ops/sec | +12.5% |
| LPUSH     | 74,850 ops/sec | 72,254 ops/sec | -3.5%  |
| RPUSH     | 73,000 ops/sec | 73,964 ops/sec | +1.3%  |
| SADD      | 78,900 ops/sec | 75,301 ops/sec | -4.6%  |
| HSET      | 78,600 ops/sec | 72,464 ops/sec | -7.8%  |

The impact varies by operation type, with write operations showing slight regressions (1-8%) and read operations showing improvements. This is a reasonable trade-off for the added memory visibility.

## Lua Testing Results

### Lua VM Implementation Status

The Lua VM implementation has been significantly improved, providing better register allocation, memory management, and JSON encoding support. Current status:

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Basic Arithmetic | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly calculates expressions like `1 + 2 * 3` |
| String Operations | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly concatenates strings like `"hello" .. " " .. "world"` |
| Local Variables | ‚úÖ PASS | Properly handles local variable declarations and access |
| Function Calls | ‚úÖ PASS | Basic function definitions and calls work correctly |
| Table Operations | ‚úÖ PASS | Table creation and field access work correctly |
| Simple String Concatenation | ‚úÖ PASS | `t.str .. ' world'` correctly returns concatenated string |
| Complex Table Concatenation | ‚ùå FAIL | Multiple table field operations like `t.foo .. ' ' .. t.baz` fail |
| KEYS Access | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly handles access to the special KEYS table |
| Redis Call Integration | ‚úÖ PASS | Basic `redis.call()` functionality works correctly |
| JSON Encoding | ‚úÖ PASS | `cjson.encode(t)` correctly produces JSON representation |
| Garbage Collection | ‚úÖ PASS | Memory is properly reclaimed after script execution |

### JSON Library Support

The cjson library has been implemented with the following features:

1. **cjson.encode**: Now properly handles all Lua data types:
   - Primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans, nil)
   - Tables (both array-like and object-like)
   - Nested structures with proper type conversion
   - Cycle detection to prevent infinite recursion
   - Proper JSON string escaping

2. **cjson.decode**: Basic implementation in place, but not fully functional.

### Register Allocation Improvements

A major focus of the recent work has been fixing the compiler's register allocation strategy, particularly for table field access in concatenation expressions:

1. Improved handling of table field access during compilation
2. Enhanced concatenation operation in the VM to better collect and process values
3. Fixed issues with stack management during nested function calls

## Strengths

1. **All Core Data Structures**: Complete implementation of strings, lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets
2. **Protocol Compliance**: 100% RESP protocol compatibility for implemented features
3. **Error Handling**: Proper Redis-compatible error messages
4. **Stability**: No crashes during comprehensive testing
5. **Transactions**: Working MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD/WATCH implementation
6. **Persistence**: Both RDB and AOF implementation
7. **Pub/Sub System**: Full implementation with pattern support
8. **Pipeline Support**: Excellent performance with pipelined operations
9. **Concurrent Clients**: Robust handling of high client counts
10. **Performance**: Outstanding performance metrics, with pipelined operations exceeding Redis in some cases
11. **Replication**: Working master-slave replication with proper authentication and data synchronization
12. **Monitoring Suite**: Complete implementation of SLOWLOG, MONITOR, and CLIENT commands
13. **Memory Tracking**: Comprehensive memory usage tracking and analysis
14. **Lua Integration**: Functional Lua VM with cjson.encode support and stable execution

## Known Limitations and Next Steps

1. **Table Field Concatenation**: Issues with complex table field concatenation operations in Lua scripts
2. **JSON Decoding**: cjson.decode implementation needs completion
3. **Security Features**: Command renaming/disabling and protected mode remain to be implemented
4. **Fine-grained Memory Control**: Current memory tracking is precise but could benefit from custom allocator integration
5. **Key Migration Commands**: Not yet implemented, important for cluster support

## Conclusion

Ferrous has reached an important milestone with the completion of core production readiness features and significant improvements to the Lua VM implementation. The server demonstrates excellent performance characteristics very close to Redis benchmark targets. The implementation of cjson.encode is now complete and working correctly, though some limitations remain with table field concatenation operations.

Next steps will focus on completing the cjson.decode functionality, resolving the remaining table field concatenation issues, and implementing the security features needed for production deployment.
