# Control Flow Tests

This directory contains tests for Lua control flow mechanisms:

- For loops (numeric)
- Generic loops (pairs/ipairs)
- Conditionals
- Function returns

**Note:** Some of these tests are expected to fail in the current implementation.
These tests help track progress on fixing critical VM issues.
