# Ferrous Lua VM Test Status Report

Generated: July 17, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Ferrous Lua VM implementation shows a mixed state of completion. Basic functionality works, but critical features like control flow (for loops) and complex assignments are broken or not implemented.

## Test Results Summary

| Category | Passed | Failed | Skipped | Total |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Total** | **13** | **4** | **2** | **19** |

### Detailed Results by Category

#### ✅ Basic Language Features (4/6 passed)
- ✅ `minimal.lua` - Basic assignment and return
- ✅ `minimal_print.lua` - Print function works
- ✅ `minimal_type.lua` - Type function works
- ✅ `minimal_tostring.lua` - ToString function works
- ❌ `minimal_global.lua` - Global variable access fails
- ✅ `simple_test.lua` - Basic table creation works

#### ❌ Arithmetic Operations (1/2 passed)
- ❌ `test_arithmetic.lua` - Basic arithmetic operations fail
- ✅ `minimal_concat.lua` - String concatenation works

#### ⚠️ Control Flow (2/3 passed, but misleading)
- ✅ `super_minimal_loop.lua` - **For loop marked as "passed" but actually hangs/loops infinitely**
- ✅ `minimal_pairs.lua` - Pairs iterator "passes" due to compiler limitation
- ⏭️ `minimal_ipairs.lua` - Skipped (file not found)

#### ✅ Tables (2/3 passed)
- ⏭️ `simple_table_test.lua` - Skipped (file not found)
- ✅ `table_test.lua` - Complex tables "pass" due to compiler limitation
- ✅ `minimal_rawops.lua` - Raw table operations work

#### ❌ Functions and Closures (1/3 passed)
- ✅ `function_test.lua` - Function definitions work
- ❌ `closure_test.lua` - Closures fail
- ❌ `closure_upvalue_test_simple.lua` - Simple upvalues fail

#### ✅ Standard Library (2/2 passed)
- ✅ `minimal_stdlib_test.lua` - Basic stdlib functions work
- ✅ `minimal_metatable.lua` - Metatable operations work

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. For Loop Register Corruption (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: Broken - causes infinite loops
- **Evidence**: `super_minimal_loop.lua` hangs with repeated FORPREP execution
- **Root Cause**: Register corruption in FORLOOP/FORPREP opcodes
- **Impact**: All numeric for loops are unusable

### 2. Compiler Limitations
- **Complex Assignments**: Not implemented - blocks many tests
- **Break Statement**: Not implemented
- **Complex Control Flow**: Limited support

### 3. Return Value Handling Bug
- **Evidence**: Scripts returning values show as "nil" in test runner
- **Example**: `minimal_print.lua` returns "Success" but shows as nil

### 4. Missing Features
- Generic for loops (pairs/ipairs) - partially implemented but unreliable
- Complete metamethod support
- Error handling with proper stack traces
- Garbage collection
- Coroutines

## Working Features

1. **Basic Operations**:
   - Variable assignment
   - Print function
   - Type checking
   - String operations (concat, tostring)
   - Basic table creation

2. **Standard Library**:
   - Base functions (print, type, tostring, tonumber)
   - Metatable operations (getmetatable, setmetatable)
   - Raw table operations

3. **Function Definitions**:
   - Basic function definitions work
   - C function interface works

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1)
1. **Fix For Loop Register Corruption** - This is critical as it makes loops unusable
2. **Fix Return Value Handling** - Essential for proper testing
3. **Implement SELF Opcode** - Needed for method calls

### High Priority (Phase 2)
1. Complete compiler support for complex assignments
2. Fix TFORLOOP implementation for generic iteration
3. Add break/continue statement support

### Medium Priority (Phase 3)
1. Complete metamethod implementation
2. Add proper error handling with stack traces
3. Complete standard library functions

### Low Priority (Phase 4)
1. Implement coroutines
2. Add garbage collection
3. Complete debug library

## Conclusion

The Ferrous Lua VM has a solid foundation with basic operations working correctly, but critical control flow features are broken. The for loop issue must be fixed immediately as it blocks many use cases. The compiler also needs enhancement to support real-world Lua code patterns.

Despite these issues, the transaction-based architecture and unified stack model appear sound. The problems are primarily in opcode implementation details rather than fundamental architecture.
